 i like the theme of your project, only issue i noticed is that you did hello world but the one required is say hello, aside from that very good work, keep it up :)





Thing different from figma on purpose:
1. added buttons to pages that needed them (adding numbers and asking questions etc)
2. made a computer output window for, well, computer output
3. Addeed greater than less than since it was missing from the figma
4. removed guess it  
5. contained the content of MadLib in a box so the user doesnt have to scroll the entire page
6. the background crops with width change, that way it isn't squished together on smaller resolutions
